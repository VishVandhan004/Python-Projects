        2. **JD Match %** ‚Äì Estimate how well the resume aligns with the job description. Consider skills, qualifications, responsibilities, and terminology.
        3. **Missing Keywords** ‚Äì List important terms or phrases from the JD that are missing in the resume.
        4. **Profile Summary** ‚Äì Write a professional summary of the candidate based on the resume.
        5. **Good Aspects of the Resume** ‚Äì Highlight what‚Äôs working well (e.g., relevant experience, quantifiable achievements, good formatting) in a detailed way.
