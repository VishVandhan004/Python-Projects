Jinja2: For dynamic HTML templating using Flask.
SQLite / SQLAlchemy (likely): Simple and fast database for storing user credentials and expenses.

🔹 Other:
Session Management via Flask for user isolation.
Templating System allows code reuse and separation of logic from views.

🚀 Key Learnings & Interview Talking Points:
Modular Architecture: Each HTML file serves a unique purpose, enabling scalable UI management.
Full-stack Development: Built from ground up using Flask, integrating frontend, backend, and analytics.

🗣️ How to Conclude in an Interview:
“Cashflow Commander was a full-stack personal finance web app I built to apply both backend and frontend skills in a real-world context. It helped me deepen my understanding of Flask routing, session management, templating with Jinja, and presenting dynamic financial data visually using Chart.js. If given the opportunity, I’d love to scale it into a fully-featured budget planner or even deploy it as a SaaS tool.”
